#### Users of the system

BionicHealthERP accomodates.

* Unlimited Health-care Centers
* Unlimited Health Insurance Scheme
* General End Users 

#### Purpose of the Solution

* **BionicHealthERP**'s main purpose is to create a huge dataset that is satisfactory enough for detailed data documentation within the community, state and country by building the platform for most health activities in the sector
* Tracking health facilities to assist prompt and supervisory activities in the sector
* Drug inventory analysis in the country and prompt search for drugs available in the country by end-users
* A system that not only provides platforms for the health sector but also for details system reporting and accessability to the ministry of health/ Health Schemes keeping An up-to-date information management system that captures the estimated number of patients to health facilities.
* The Insurance Scheme lacks a technology-based system for the database of all the enrollees, to monitor the insurance services pertaining to health
A system needs to be developed to address the absenteeism of staff from workstations in the Education and Health sectors
* Event meeting setup any where in the country by either the healthcare sector or government

## BionicHealthERP (Dependencies)

The system depends solely on the Grid-Nigeria api as it has over **44,000** health-care centers which can first be used as an avenue for system validation and verification on the health-care account made on the system.

The option value was pulled from https://api.grid-nigeria.org/health-facilities/ 

if the hospital is unavailable other method would be used to add the health-care center not available to the api but after a thorough check has been done to worth been in the data

## BionicHealthERP (Expansaion)

The system has the ability to provide **104 datasets** which can be rendered back to the https://api.grid-nigeria.org/health-facilities/ at the moment of each platform request to create a wharehouse for adequate and available data resource



## System Updates & Upgrades 

Taking **BionicHealthERP** systems as a full-time activity, we monitor to provide stress-free system to the end-user as upgrades and updates are made by developers. You are just to provide your data to the system and the developers would carry out the rest activities. The **BionicHealthERP** has a good coding condition and is well sustainable and managable for all end-user parties.

## Existing Systems
Based there are a couple of system which have been available for a while in the tech industry both home and abroad. But what would make the **BionicHealthERP** stand out are as follows:

#### Open source platform: Most applications are paid for and are made available for health organizations to remit monthly or daily funds. **BionicHealthERP** is here to make all these activities.

#### Open Chain Data for investment: Even as most concentration has been given to the fintech organization not just because of the fact that they made profit but an open data chain was made visible to investors to leverage in the Nigerian market. It is reported in **The Nigerian Startup Funding Report** that

>investments made in the third quarter of 2018.
>Nigerian Startups got $34,710,957 of which 60% where handed over to fintech industry
>The Health startup featured 4 startups in that quarter of which one got seed-funding while others got grants

The ability to provide an open chain of data structures to investors would create opportunities for investments. Also startups can build platform ideas that would create more convincing power and wide range fundings which can in double fold exceed the fintech industry especially when it comes to handling the matters of health and life. **BionicHealthERP** will provide it all.


#### More Updates to flexible solutions: Most existing systems despite robust are unable to solve most specific problem of individual organization maybe due to data structure implementation. **BionicHealthERP** is flexible enough to run system in a polymorphic structure as the organization fits accomodating limitless services



## Challenges we ran into
Building a data-set system is a huge one and the challenge was trying to structure the system to our propose features avoiding data collation and polymorphic request issues. So we got to study more on data structures and algorithms which are the basic for any sustainable system. It was the most difficult at first but we pull through to understand that the codility and code-convention structure of a platform matters in system architecture and not just jumping into any codes/language for solutions.


## Period of development
The period of completion of the **BionicHealthERP** would take about 57days to implement and test before launch.
